            <h2> Instagram <img src="./assets/insta.jpg" alt=""> Recent Events </h2>
            <p> Since 2017, Instagram has undergone significant transformations and introduced several key features that
                have reshaped its platform and user experience. Here’s a detailed overview of these developments:

                Instagram launched Stories in 2016, allowing users to share ephemeral photos and videos that disappear
                after 24 hours. This feature quickly gained popularity for its user-friendly interface and integration
                with Instagram's existing features.

                In November 2016, Instagram expanded its live video feature, enabling users to broadcast live videos to
                their followers in real-time. This feature enhanced user engagement by providing an immediate and
                interactive way for users to connect with their audience.

                February 2017 saw the introduction of carousel posts, allowing users to share up to ten photos and
                videos in a single post that followers can swipe through horizontally. This feature empowered users to
                tell richer stories and showcase multiple perspectives in a single post.

                Instagram launched Stories Highlights in December 2017, enabling users to save their favorite Stories
                beyond the 24-hour limit. Highlights appear on users' profiles, allowing them to curate and showcase
                content they want to keep accessible to their followers.

                IGTV was announced in 2017 and launched in June 2018 as a standalone app for long-form vertical videos
                up to one hour in length. IGTV aimed to compete with platforms like YouTube and catered to content
                creators looking to share longer, more polished video content.

                March 2018 saw the introduction of Shopping Tags, allowing businesses to tag products in their posts and
                Stories. Users can tap on tagged products to view more details and make purchases directly within the
                Instagram app, transforming the platform into a viable e-commerce platform.

                In October 2019, Instagram removed the Following tab, which allowed users to see the activity of
                accounts they followed, such as likes and comments on other posts. This change aimed to enhance user
                privacy and reduce the feeling of constant surveillance.

                Instagram has continuously adjusted its algorithm to prioritize content based on user engagement,
                relevance, and timeliness. These changes impact how content appears in users' feeds and Stories,
                influencing reach and engagement strategies for users and businesses alike.

                In August 2020, Instagram launched Reels, a short-form video feature allowing users to create and
                discover entertaining videos set to music. Reels aimed to compete with the growing popularity of TikTok
                and provided another avenue for creative expression and content discovery on the platform.

                These developments have transformed Instagram into a multifaceted platform for social interaction,
                content creation, e-commerce, and digital marketing. They have significantly impacted digital culture
                and online engagement strategies, solidifying Instagram's position as one of the leading social media
                platforms globally.</p>

            <h2> React for Reactors </h2>
            <p> React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, has evolved significantly since its inception.
                Here's an overview of its key developments and milestones:

                React was initially developed by Facebook and released for public use in 2013. It introduced a
                component-based architecture, allowing developers to build encapsulated UI components that manage their
                own state.

                The introduction of JSX (JavaScript XML) simplified the process of writing React components by enabling
                HTML-like syntax within JavaScript, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

                React gained popularity for its Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) reconciliation algorithm, which
                optimizes rendering performance by updating only the necessary components when data changes.

                React Native, launched by Facebook in 2015, extended React's capabilities to mobile app development for
                iOS and Android platforms. It allows developers to build native mobile apps using React and JavaScript.

                The ecosystem around React has expanded with the introduction of Redux for state management, React
                Router for routing within single-page applications, and GraphQL for efficient data fetching.

                React Fiber, a complete rewrite of React's core algorithm, was introduced to improve performance and
                enable new features like Concurrent Mode and Suspense. These features optimize rendering and data
                fetching, enhancing user experience in React applications.

                React Hooks, introduced in React 16.8 (February 2019), revolutionized state management and side effects
                handling in functional components, providing a more concise and flexible approach compared to class
                components.

                React continues to evolve with regular updates and community-driven contributions, maintaining its
                position as a leading choice for building modern web and mobile applications.

                These advancements have solidified React's role in frontend development, offering developers powerful
                tools for creating scalable, efficient, and interactive user interfaces across various platforms.</p>

            <h2> R for Statistician </h2>
            <p> RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for the R programming language, has seen
                significant developments and milestones since its inception. Here’s an overview of its key developments
                and features:

                RStudio was first released in 2011 by RStudio, Inc., providing a powerful IDE tailored for R
                programming. It offers a user-friendly interface with various tools to enhance the R coding experience.

                The IDE includes features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and a built-in R console,
                facilitating interactive coding and rapid prototyping of data analysis and visualization tasks.

                RStudio introduced Projects, enabling users to organize their work into separate directories with
                specific settings, facilitating collaboration and reproducibility in data analysis workflows.

                The IDE supports version control systems like Git and SVN, allowing users to manage and track changes in
                their projects seamlessly.

                RMarkdown, introduced in 2014, integrates markdown syntax with R code chunks, enabling users to create
                dynamic documents that blend narrative text, code, and output (such as tables and plots) in a single
                document. This feature has become popular for reproducible research and automated report generation.

                Shiny, introduced in 2012, is an R package integrated into RStudio that allows users to create
                interactive web applications directly from R scripts. Shiny apps can range from simple dashboards to
                complex data-driven applications, enabling data scientists to share insights and analyses with
                stakeholders.

                RStudio Server and RStudio Server Pro provide web-based versions of the IDE, allowing remote access to
                RStudio and facilitating collaboration among team members and across different computing environments.

                The RStudio ecosystem has expanded with the introduction of packages like tidyverse (a collection of R
                packages for data science), ggplot2 (for data visualization), and caret (for machine learning).

                RStudio has a vibrant community and actively supports open-source contributions, enhancing its
                capabilities through user feedback and community-driven development.

                Overall, RStudio has evolved into a comprehensive IDE for R programming, catering to the needs of data
                scientists, statisticians, and researchers for data analysis, visualization, and application
                development. Its user-friendly interface, integration with popular R packages, and support for
                reproducible research make it a preferred choice among R users worldwide.</p>
